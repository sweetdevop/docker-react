# docker-react
Docker-react is just an example of DevOps process learning purpose.
I learn how to run a nginx running a tiny web with a redis-server, running as a cache memory.
The purpose of this project is to enable automate the application deployement so that when the developer 
wants to lunch a new release, the change with be taking in consideration automatically by rebuilding the docker file, sending 
to my github and deploy to travis CI as test Environment and deploy on AWS as Production Environment.
